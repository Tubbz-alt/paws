\section{Introduction}

The goal of \verb|slacx| is to provide a fast, stable, and flexible platform
for the analysis of image-like data. 
Much of the early development focused on supporting workflows 
for processing x-ray diffraction patterns. 
In principle, however, many other kinds of data could be processed by \verb|slacx|.
For this reason, a priority in \verb|slacx| development is to maintain a flexible platform
for users to develop their own processing routes.
With basic programming knowledge, 
users can develop operations 
that load automatically into the \verb|slacx| engine
and become available for use in workflows.
Instructions and a template for developing \verb|slacx| operations
are given in chapter~\ref{ch:op_dev}.
