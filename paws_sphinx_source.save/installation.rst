Quick Start
-----------

Minimal and usually-effective installation instructions.

Here is a reference to the :ref:`brief introduction <ch-introduction>`.

:ref:`This chapter <sec-quickstart>` is for setting up PAWS quickly
in an environment that is prepared to install Python packages with pip.
To install PAWS, enter::
 
pip install pypaws 

The only dependency of PAWS is pyyaml,
used for serializing and de-serializing workflow data.
pip should automatically install this along with PAWS.

The PAWS GUI modules are not explicitly supported by the package dependencies.
To use PAWS GUI modules, install PySide into your Python environment::

pip install PySide
