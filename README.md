## Synopsis

`slacx` is designed to be a fast, lean, and modular 
workflow manager for image-like data.
Beginning with raw pixel data, 
`slacx` operations can be written to perform calibration, 
data cleaning, dimensionality reduction (e.g. integration),
feature extraction, peak analysis, custom operations, 
and packaging and visualization of results.
The `slacx` engine and gui also drop in 
as the batch processing plugin for `xi-cam`.

## Code Example

There is no code.

## Motivation

Too many graduate students spend too many hours 
agonizing over highly repeatable operations
for x-ray data analysis.
A fast and easy-to-use software package
for this purpose is long overdue.

## Installation

There is nothing to install.

## API Reference

An API would be a really good idea.

## Tests

Tests would be a really good idea.

## Contributors

Instructions for adding modules to the workflow will go here.

## License

Currently this is a private repository.
A distribution license should be chosen before it is shared.
